# Rocket.Chat

Wellawell... what will you do in case you want to contact someone via the modern digital way? Calling is so 1990s and adding everyone to WhatsApp, having thousands of groups is not what you wanna have.

Introducing Rocket.Chat - our self-hosted magical modern instant messaging and chatroom application. Yes, finally - some people have brought back chatrooms and channels! (We cannot wait for Comic Sans getting popular again!)

## Getting started

Let's jump right into the cold water! :snowflake:

### 1. Login
You can use your SHC login credentials that you can use for all our services to login. Visit <https://chat.grh-hamburg.de>, enter your credentials, provided by the Digital Services Team and you're in!

### 2. Channels

After logging in, you will see a window greeting you - and a sidebar on the left hand side. Hold on for a second, there's stuff to see!

Rocket.Chat is dividing conversations smartypanty into channels, discussions, threads and direct messages. This sounds like a Matroska puppet, but stick with me for a second!

- **Channels** are written with a `#` in the beginning and are mostly divided into teams (project teams or core SHC teams). These can be public (so you can join a channel by yourself or leave it) or private (for your secrets, sssh!).
- **Discussions** are more temporarily channeling ... well... discussions (surprise!) to specific topics. To create a discussion, right click onto a message and choose the option "Start a discussion".
- **Threads** are mostly used to answer to a message. It is not a big discussion, but we should use threads to make answers to messages more traceable. *(Just imagine you want to answer `OK` after two other friendly cats have shot their message before you were even able to answer to that handsome dudette two messages before.)*
- **Direct messages** You and another person want to work on a very secret master plan? Feel welcomed by writing a direct message to that person!

These can be found on the right hand side of the chat window. But there's more: on the top you will find your profile information, your online status, some even more awesome settings and the **Directory** (visible by the :globe_with_meridians: icon). Through that you can find other channels you might wanna join or be interested to join to.

### 3. Write a message

Yes, this is an instant messaging service, so write a message! Click on `#general` channel on the right hand side and write:
```text
Hello dudes and dudettes :wave: I have successfully finished the tutorial to Rocket.Chat!.
```
